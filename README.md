# Multi Linear Regression Model for Profit Prediction

This repository contains a project focused on creating a multi-linear regression model to predict the profit of a business based on various features from the dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is named **`50_Startups.csv`** and includes features such as:
- **R&D Spend**: Investment in research and development.
- **Administration**: Spending on administrative activities.
- **Marketing Spend**: Budget allocated for marketing.
- **State**: Location of the business.
- **Profit**: Target variable indicating the profit of the startup.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to predict the profit of a business using various independent variables in the dataset.

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Encode categorical data (e.g., `State`).
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Development**:
   - Create a multi-linear regression model.
   - Train the model on the training set.
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.
3. **Prediction**:
   - Use the model to predict the profit based on input features.

## Libraries used
following Python libraries used :
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
